# Basic Cloud Server Setup

When it comes to setting up a cloud server, you can confidently choose Digital Ocean, AWS or any other popular platform. Simply sign up and dive into the dashboard to get started.

Next, we should proceed by completing the following steps:

1. Create a machine (VM) according to your requirements.
2. Connect with SSH to you local machine using the public IP, so that you can operate the cloud machine from your local machine terminal. Firstly, we may need to connect with root user.
3. Create a new user for operating the machine. Cause using root user to operate the machine is not a good practice.
4. Add the new user to sudo group.
5. Obviously, change SSH port so that, someone cannot try to connect with default port 22.
6. That's it for setting up a basic cloud server.
