# Installation

This playbook offers a range of commands and examples that specifically require Ubuntu as the preferred operating system. Let's take a look at how we can set up Ubuntu on a machine.

## Installing Ubuntu Desktop on Virtual Maching

I understand that starting on a new platform like Linux can be overwhelming, especially for beginners. That's why I'll begin with setting up the desktop, which has a graphical interface that many find easier to navigate. I want you to feel comfortable and confident as you learn. So, let's start with desktop setup.
Also I completely understand that you want to keep your existing operating system neat and clean without any hampers. One way to achieve this is by using Virtual Machine software such as [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/) or [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/). This can help you create a safe and isolated environment that won't interfere with your current system.

Let's dive right in and get started!

1. Installing a Virtual Machine is quite simple! Just choose the installation file that matches your operating system and version, and you're good to go. You can select either [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/), [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/), [Xen Project](https://xenproject.org/) or whatever you want. But VMWare and Virtual Box both software are popular and easy to use.

2. Excellent work! I assume you have successfully installed **Virtual Box** on your local machine. Now, let's download Ubuntu from this link ([https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)) to proceed with the next step without any hassle. Choose your preferred version. But I suggest you to download LTS version. LTS mean Long-term Support, that is you'll receive regular security updates and support for a longer period of time.

3. Download complete! Let's open VirtualBox. After opening you will see like the following
   ![VirtualBox home page](./../images/installation/1.png "VirtualBox home page")

4. To create a new virtual machine, click on the `New` button. A window will appear where you will need to enter the name of your VM, its location, select the type of operating system and choose its version. You will also need to specify the location of the ISO image file. However, for now, we will skip selecting ISO file and simply click on 'Continue'.
   ![Creating New VM](./../images/installation/2.png "Creating New VM")

5. Now have to specify the amount of RAM, the number of processors, and disk space required for the machine.
   ![Specify RAM, Processors, and disk space](./../images/installation/3.png "Specify RAM, Processors, and disk space")

   ![Specify Disk space](./../images/installation/4.png "Specify Disk space")

   And finally, simply click on `Finish` button.
   ![Finish creating VM](./../images/installation/5.png "Finish creating VM")

6. Now we've our VM. But inside it, there is no operating system right now. It's time to install an operating system on our VM. To get started, double-click on the virtual machine that you just created in VirtualBox. Don't waste any time, let's get the installation process going!
   ![After creating VM](./../images/installation/6.png "After creating VM")

7. As soon as you open the VM, confidently expect a prompt asking for either a mounted DVD or ISO file of the OS. The image below shows you exactly what to expect:
   ![Mount ISO](./../images/installation/7.png "Mount ISO")

   After giving the ISO file or selecting the ISO file location that you've downloaded a bit ago, click on `Mount and Retry Boot`.
   Then it will boot again, and you may see a screen like the following:
   ![Boot screen](./../images/installation/8.png "Boot screen")

   Select `Try or Install Ubuntu`.

8. The installation process is started. Select your language and press `Install Ubuntu`.
   ![Installation first screen](./../images/installation/9.png "First installation screen")

9. In this stage, select your keyboard layout and press `Continue`
   ![Select Keyboard layout](./../images/installation/10.png "Select Keyboard layout")

10. Now to proceed with partitioning, you have two options. If you prefer not to manually partition, simply select `Erase disk and install Ubuntu`. However, be aware that this will delete all data on your disk. Alternatively, I recommend selecting `Something else` and clicking `Continue`.
    ![Select installation type](./../images/installation/11.png "Select installation type")

11. Choose your needs.
    ![Updates and Softwares](./../images/installation/12.png "Updates and Softwares")

12. Now you have the window where you'll setup your partition. Click on `New partition table` to create a new partition table.
    ![Partition start](./../images/installation/13.png "Partition start")

    Creating a new partition table, you will see the window like the following:
    ![Partition table created](./../images/installation/14.png "Partition table created")

    Click on the `+` button to create partition. We need to create at least the following partitions: <br >
    _i. EFI System Partition - at least 100 MB_ <br >
    _ii. Reserved BIOS Boot Area - at least 1 MB_ <br >
    _iii. /boot - 256-500 MB at least_ <br >
    _iv. / - the rest of the free space_ <br >

    So start creating one by one, Let's start with `/boot` first. It's recommended to use EXT4 type for all the partitions.
    ![Create boot partition](./../images/installation/15.png "Create boot partition")
    ![Created boot partition](./../images/installation/16.png "Created boot partition")

    After that, create `EFI System Partition` and `Reserved BIOS Boot Area`.
    ![Create EFI and Reserved BIOS](./../images/installation/17.png "Create EFI and Reserved BIOS")
    ![Create EFI and Reserved BIOS](./../images/installation/18.png "Create EFI and Reserved BIOS")

    Lastly, create partition for `root` directory and press `Install Now`.  
    ![Create root partition](./../images/installation/19.png "Create root partition")

    You'll see now the review of your partition system. Check and click on `Continue`.
    ![Review partition](./../images/installation/20.png "Review Partition")

13. Select your timezone.
    ![Select timezone](./../images/installation/21.png "Select timezone")

14. We're almost there. In this stage, we need to put **Login credentials**. Click on `Continue` and wait for some minutes.
    ![Login creds](./../images/installation/22.png "Login Credentials")

15. Once the installation is finished, you will be prompted to restart your machine.
    ![Restart your VM](./../images/installation/23.png "Restart your VM")

16. While restarting your machine, you may be asked to unmount or remove your installation media. For this, just simply press `Enter` on the keyboard cause we haven't used any external pendrive or disk or DVD for installation.
    ![Unmount Installation](./../images/installation/24.png "Unmount Installation")

    Then your virtual machine will be restarted.

    ![Final show](./../images/installation/25.png "Fresh Ubuntu Desktop")

There, you go! You've successfully installed Ubuntu on your virtual machine.
