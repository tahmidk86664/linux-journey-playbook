# Level up Nginx server

In this session, we will cover additional Nginx server configurations. Specifically, we will prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files such as environment files.

Let's look at the following configuration code (line start with **hash (#)** is a comment):

```
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name your_domain.com www.your_domain.com;

  access_log /var/log/nginx/your_access_log_file.log;
  error_log  /var/log/nginx/your_error_log_file.log;

  root location_of_your_application;
  index index_file;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
  }

  # We can block a single IP
  deny 193.120.33.10;

  # To block access of env file
  location ~ /\.env {
    deny all;
  }

  # To block access of secret files
  location ~ /\. {
    deny all;
  }
}
```
