# Nginx on Subdomain

Let's learn how to set up our nginx server on a subdomain. The steps are the same as before, but we need to replace the domain name in the `server_name` property with our desired subdomain.

If we take a look at our previous nginx configuration:

```
   server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain.com www.your_domain.com;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/your_access_log_file.log;
    error_log  /var/log/nginx/your_error_log_file.log;

    root location_of_your_page;
    index index_file;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
   }
```

Here, for setting up the subdomain, we need to modify the server_name by adding the subdomain name. The updated config will look like:

```
   server {
    listen 80;
    server_name subdomain.your_domain.com;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/your_access_log_file.log;
    error_log  /var/log/nginx/your_error_log_file.log;

    root location_of_your_page_for_subdomain;
    index index_file;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
   }
```

**Note:** It's obvious to create a A record in your domain management for your subdomain pointing to your domain or IP.
